You are given two strings current and correct representing two 24-hour times.

24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.

In one operation you can increase the time current by 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes. You can perform this operation any number of times.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert current to correct.



Example 1:

Input: current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
- Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
Example 2:

Input: current = "11:00", correct = "11:01"
Output: 1
Explanation: We only have to add one minute to current, so the minimum number of operations needed is 1.


Constraints:

current and correct are in the format "HH:MM"
current <= correct

Given an integer array nums, return true if nums is consecutive, otherwise return false.

An array is consecutive if it contains every number in the range [x, x + n - 1] (inclusive), where x is the minimum number in the array and n is the length of the array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
The minimum value is 1 and the length of nums is 4.
All of the values in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [1, 1 + 4 - 1] = [1, 4] = (1, 2, 3, 4) occur in nums.
Therefore, nums is consecutive.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: false
Explanation:
The minimum value is 1 and the length of nums is 2.
The value 2 in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [1, 1 + 2 - 1], = [1, 2] = (1, 2) does not occur in nums.
Therefore, nums is not consecutive.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,5,4]
Output: true
Explanation:
The minimum value is 3 and the length of nums is 3.
All of the values in the range [x, x + n - 1] = [3, 3 + 3 - 1] = [3, 5] = (3, 4, 5) occur in nums.
Therefore, nums is consecutive.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number

A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.



Example 1:

Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
Example 2:

Input: start = 3, goal = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
- Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
